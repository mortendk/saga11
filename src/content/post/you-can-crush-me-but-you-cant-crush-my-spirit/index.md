# You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!

Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Do a flip! I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.

Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Bite my shiny metal ass. **Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.** *I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up!* Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

## Look, last night was a mistake.

Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!

1. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!
2. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.
3. Anyone who laughs is a communist!

### Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…

That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!

- Meh.
- I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.
- Take me to your leader!

Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. Soothe us with sweet lies. You are the last hope of the universe. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Bender, you risked your life to save me!

Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! I just told you! You've killed me! Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long.

Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!

Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?

What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me!

I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! I love you, buddy! Bender, quit destroying the universe! Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Fry, we have a crate to deliver.

Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. You know, I was God once. Who are those horrible orange men? Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."

Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.

Leela's gonna kill me. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! How much did you make me? Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."

Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Is that a cooking show? Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."

Oh sure! Blame the wizards! No. We're on the top. But I've never been to the moon! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!
