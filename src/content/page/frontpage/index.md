      ## I started a sensory


      I started a sensory deprivation chamber business - it involves really dark curtains, ear plugs, and a sleeping mask. Twitter is the rice of social media. If you were a member of the Bloods and became paralyzed do you then become a member of the Crips?. We need more werkin and less twerkin if you ask me. Balooby. INjuries always keep you OUT of things. Visticula.


      ## If the word kerning is kerned poorly

      If the word kerning is kerned poorly, it kind of looks like learning - which is appropriate because both are important. Thank you for using my words in your work. This is a true fact: I never had a fear of heights until I fell off a roof. Cemeteries are just garbage dumps filled with humans. Smiling could easily be misinterpreted for showing your teeth to someone because they said something that made you happy.


      I'm still upset that Tie Domi didn't name his child Tyson. Thank you for using my words in your work. If you work for an ad agency and getting paid for it aren't you the one who is being influenced by advertising?. A tagline for an airline: Take the High Road. A tagline for a special highway that is easy to navigate while under the influence of drugs: Take the High Road.
