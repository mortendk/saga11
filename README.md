# What is this

Saga11 build websites, based on 11ty and netlifycms

The wish is to have a system where the webdesigner can have complete control over the markup

Content and settings are build with markdown and json files.
netlifycms is configured to edit the files
The files are compiled to flat html files with 11ty using nunjucks templates.

As a default the standard templates are using tailwind and alpine, but thats totally optional.

- At the end "its just html, css, js" :)

## Tech stack
